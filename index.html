            <p class = "desc" style = "margin-top: 5rem; text-align: center; font-size: 1.5rem;">A first-year computer science University student at Wilfrid Laurier University, who received a $2,500 entrance scholarship. I finished my first semester with an average GPA excluding electives being 11.67. I plan on switching my degree to a data science major in the second year to focus more on computer science's statistics and math side. I also have an interest in the computer engineering route and even received the Award Of Excellence in Computer Engineering which is conferred on a student whose academic performance during the year demonstrates remarkable consistency at the highest level of achievement during my graduate year. I currently work at Walmart Pharmacy as an over-the-counter associate, working part-time in 8-hour shifts without any complaints. I am incredibly lenient with my time during work and am completely fine with giving up some lunch or break time to help out my co-workers when they are busy. I am also bilingual which has helped me service customers who can only speak Korean with their needs. My goal is to understand programming so well that I can create many side-projects to teach to others and inspire them as I once was.</p>
